This is my homework submission for week 4. In this repository, it contains five files. First one is the "index2.html"![link](index2.html), which is the main page where includes the Start Page; Questions Page and End Page.

Second file is "Scoreboard.html"[link](scorboard.html), this file records the list of scores from each participated users, and it also links back to the main page and contains a clear scores button to clear the results. 

Third file is "q.js" [link](q.js), this javascript file contains all the actions that shows on "index2.html"

Forth file is "scoreboard.js" [link](scorboard.js), this javascript file contains actions that records the scores from each user.

Fifth file is the "style2.css" [link](style2.css), this css file contains all styles that display on both html files.

The rule of the quiz is that: There are 5 coding related questions about html, css, javascript, etc, you have 75 seconds to complete the quiz, each wrong answer will subtract 15 seconds from your time, score is counted by how much time remaining, whoever has the highest score wins!
